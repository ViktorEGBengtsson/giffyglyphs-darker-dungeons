				<h1 id="dread">Dread</h1>
        <p>Powerful forces enact their will on the world, shaping reality to their whims. Gods, devils, archfey, sorcerer kings, old ones—these almighty beings inspire hope in their allies and dread in their enemies. But how do they enforce their power, and what happens when you try to defy them?</p>
        <p>This chapter introduces <i>malevolent forces</i> and <i>dread</i>, and rules on how to include them in your campaign.</p>
        
        <h2>A Malevolent Force</h2>
        <p>When a powerful entity is working against you—or <i>you</i> are working against <i>it</i>—that entity becomes a <i>malevolent force</i>.</p>
        <p>A malevolent force creates <i>dread</i> wherever it has significant influence—dungeons, temples, towns, realms, etc. It can use this dread to trigger <i>dreadful consequences</i>, fuel <i>dreadful attacks</i>, and enforce <i>dreadful edicts</i> to maintain power and punish creatures—like <i>you</i>—that would dare to challenge it.</p>

            <p>Viridian, Krazak, and Zane enter Hellspire Citadel—a demon-infested keep under the malevolent influence of Baphamet, the Demon Lord of Minotaurs.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate Baphamet's power and influence, the GM has allocated 40 points of <i>dread</i> and a selection of <i>dreadful effects</i> to use against the party.</p>

        <h2>Creating Dread</h2>
        <p>When you want to act as a <i>malevolent force</i> in your campaign, it's time to create some dread. To get started, there are four basic steps to follow:</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">1</span> Create a Dread Zone</h3>
        <p>Your first step is to a) choose a <i>malevolent force</i> and b) define a region where that force is creating <i>dread</i>.</p>
        <p>These <i>dread zones</i> can be as small or as large as you like—a dungeon, a castle, a town, even an entire empire—so build one as best befits your adventure.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>A malevolent force—the Hag Queen of Darkroot Forest—has cast a <i>Dark Curse</i> over the village of Westing, turning the villagers into wild werewolves.</p>
            <p>To represent the Hag Queen's power in this region, the GM turns Westing (and the ajoining Darkroot Forest) into a single <i>dread zone</i>.</p>
          </section>
        </example>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">2</span> Assign some Dread</h3>
        <p>Next, decide how much influence your malevolent force has in this area—the more influence it has, the more dread it can create to spend on <i>dreadful effects</i>.</p>

        </list>

        <p>Once dread is spent, it is gone—but not forever. You should decide how often your dread zone will spawn new dread. Choose a rate that is thematic and consistent with the pace of your campaign:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Significant Event:</strong> Dread is created when a specific event occurs—a ritual sacrifice, the full moon rises, a certain word is said aloud, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Periodic Interval:</strong> Dread is created at a regular rate and time—hourly, daily, weekly, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The Hag Queen's influence over Westing is <i>unmistakable</i>, so the GM assigns 20 points of dread to this dread zone with the following recovery options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Event:</strong> Regain all dread when the full moon rises.</li>
              <li><strong>Event:</strong> Regain 5 dread when a creature is cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Hag Queen's influence is at it's strongest after the full moon—so beware, adventurers.</p>
          </section>
        </example>

        <col-break></col-break>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">3</span> Choose some Effects</h3>
        <p>Now you can add ways to spend dread with <i>dreadful effects</i>. There are three common types of effect:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> The malevolent force reacts to a player action, punishing them with a consequence.</li>
          <li><strong>Attack:</strong> The malevolent force empowers a monster attack or dungeon trap with dread.</li>
          <li><strong>Edict:</strong> The malevolent forces enforces a powerful rule that restricts certain action types.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a quick selection, combine 1, 2, or 3 <i>dreadful effect packages</i> (<span class="page-detail--page-number" data-target="dreadful-effect-packages"></span>) to build a rapid list of thematic options.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>Westing is a cursed, spooky village under threat from a Hag Queen. The GM combines effects from the <i>Spooky</i> and <i>Feywild</i> packages to create a selection of 10 <i>dreadful effects</i>, including <i>Entangling Roots</i>.</p>
          </section>
        </example>

          </header>
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>When a creature ends their turn after moving 5 ft or less, you can spend 1 point of dread to entangle that creature with magical roots. The creature is <i>Restrained</i> for up to one minute, and may spend its actions to attempt to break free early (Strength check vs DC 12).</p>
            <p><strong>Upcast:</strong> For each additional point of dread you spend, you can increase the DC by 1 (to a maximum of 16).</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">4</span> Start Playing</h3>
        <p>Finally, it's time to put your dread zone into effect. Spend your dread wisely, and try to act <i>in-character</i> as much as possible when you use <i>dreadful effects</i>.</p>

          <section class="panel__body">

      <page class="page page--generic page--dread">
        <h2>Spending Dread</h2>
        <p>As a malevolent force, you can spend dread in three primary ways: to trigger <i>dreadful consequences</i>, make <i>dreadful attacks</i>, and enforce <i>dreadful edicts</i>.</p>
        <p>When you create a dread zone, choose a selection of <i>dreadful effects</i> as best befits your malevolent theme.</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">A</span>Dreadful Consequences</h3>
        <p>Dreadful consequences allow you to react to character actions in specific ways, creating new obstacles to make life more difficult, dangerous, and unpredictable.</p>
        <p>These consequences can take any form—extra damage, spellcasting mishaps, sensory manipulation, cosmetic changes, etc—but should be appropriately themed for your malevolent force.</p>

        <h4>Triggering a Consequence</h4>
        <p>When a creature meets the requirements for a <i>dreadful consequence</i>, you can spend dread to trigger that effect immediately. You may do this at will for as long as the malevolent force and dread zone are both in effect.</p>
        <p><strong>No Immediate Repeats:</strong> You can't trigger the same consequence twice in one round.</p>

            </ul>

        <col-break></col-break>

        <h4>Creating a Consequence</h4>
        <p>To create your own dreadful consequence, follow these four simple steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Define a trigger:</strong> A dreadful consequence is <i>always</i> a reaction to a player action. Choose a triggering action from the table below—or create your own.</li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Define a consequence:</strong> Next, define the effect you want to take place. Choose an example type from the table below—or create your own.</p>
            <p>A consequence can take almost any form, and should (as a rule of thumb) target the triggering creature.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Assign a cost:</strong> Now assign a cost in dread points—the more severe the consequence, the higher the cost should be. Most consequences have a base cost of 1, 2, or 3 points of dread.</li>
          <li><strong>Upcasting:</strong> You may also wish to include an optional <i>upcasting feature</i>, allowing you to empower a consequence by spending more points of dread.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the theming of your dread zone and malevolent force.</p>

        <h4>Creating an Attack</h4>
        <p>To create your own dreadful attack, follow these two simple steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Create a Standard Attack:</strong> First, create a standard attack for your monster that can be used without dread.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose an Empowerment Phase:</strong> Next, decide <i>when</i> you want to empower the attack. There are three primary options: 1) before you make the attack, 2) when you hit a creature, or 3) when you miss.</li>
          <li><strong>Define an Empowering Modification:</strong> Finally, decide <i>how</i> you want the attack to change when spending dread. Choose a modification base from the table below—or create your own.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="list-autorange" data-title="Attack Modifications" data-column="Spend dread to...">
          <li>Increase the damage dealt.</li>
          <li>Change the damage type.</li>
          <li>Target one or more additional creatures.</li>
          <li>Apply a status condition.</li>
          <li>Target a different defence.</li>
          <li>Reroll the attack.</li>
          <li>Increase the critical hit range.</li>
          <li>Regain some hit points.</li>
          <li>Mark a target.</li>
          <li>Gain some temporary hit points.</li>
          <li>Regain expended spell power.</li>
          <li>Move one or more creatures.</li>
          <li>Apply a glaring wound.</li>
          <li>Apply a failed death saving throw.</li>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">C</span>Dreadful Edicts</h3>
        <p>Dreadful edicts are the purest manifestation of malevolent will. When you have gathered together enough dread, you can enact an edict and bend the rules of reality itself for an entire dread zone.</p>

          </section>
        </trait>

        <p>An edict is a passive effect that—once enacted—remains in place until you either a) spend (or otherwise lose) too much dread, or b) dismiss it as a free action.</p>
        <p><strong>Enacting an Edict:</strong> It takes one hour (unless otherwise specified) to enact an edict, and you must have the requisit amount of dread for the entire duration.</p>
        <p><strong>Multiple Edicts:</strong> You can enact—and maintain—multiple edicts at once—so long as you have enough <i>cumulative</i> dread to cover the cost of each individual edict.</p>
        <p><strong>Targeted Creatures:</strong> You may freely choose which creatures are—and are not—affected by your edicts.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The Hag Queen of Darkroot Forest has two possible edicts: <i>Terror</i> (10 dread) and <i>Primal Grasp</i> (10 dread). </p>
            <p>To enact one of these edicts, she must have at least 10 dread. To enact—and maintain—<i>both</i> edicts at the same time, she must have at least 20 dread.</p>
          </section>
        </example>

        <h4>Creating an Edict</h4>
        <p>To create your own dreadful edicts, follow these two simple steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Choose a Severity:</strong> First, decide how severe your edict is—the more severe the effect, the more dread it will require to enact and maintain:</p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px !important">
              <li><strong>Minor:</strong> (10 dread) Minor edicts apply a small penalty or disruption to a region.</li>
              <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> (20 dread) Moderate edicts are more noticable with larger penalities.</li>
              <li><strong>Major:</strong> (40 dread) Major edicts can change fundamental gameplay mechanics, forcing players to rethink their approach and plan new strategies.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Choose a Rule:</strong> Then, decide which rule should take place once the edict is in effect. Choose a rule from the tables below—or create your own unique effect.</li>

        <h2>Hope</h2>
        <p>Not <i>every</i> powerful entity wants to see you fail—some may have a vested interest in your survival and success.</p>
        <p>When these almighty beings smile on you, there is a chance you may be rewarded with some <i>hope</i>—a token of their gratitude and a defence against dread.</p>

        <h3>Gaining Hope</h3>
        <p>As you perform services and duties for powerful beings—gods, archfey, old ones, etc—you may (depending on the generosity of your benefactor) be rewarded with one or more points of <i>hope</i>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minor:</strong> You have performed some small or repetitive service to a greater power—a temple blessing, a minor sacrifice, a token offering, etc. You receive 1 hope.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> You have performed beyond expectations in your efforts. Receive 1d4 hope.</li>
          <li><strong>Major:</strong> You have performed a <i>significant</i> service to a greater power—completing a major quest, solving a large crisis, etc. You receive 2d4 hope.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hope doesn't expire, but neither does it stack—when you are gifted with hope, you must decide whether to keep your old amount or gain the new one.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>Valiant has 1 point of <i>hope</i> from his god, Kelemvor. During a week of downtime, Valiant dedicates his time to temple service and is asked to make a Wisdom (Religion) check—which he succeeds by +10.</p>
            <p>Kelemvor deems that Valiant has done a <i>moderate</i> service and rewards the cleric with 3 points of hope. Valiant can only choose one pool of hope, and so he takes the larger pool of 3 points.</p>
          </section>
        </example>

        <h3>Spending Hope</h3>
        <p>When you are targeted by a dreadful consequence or attack, you can instead spend that many points of <i>hope</i> to protect yourself from the effect.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">

              <li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>Not today, ghost—I'll spend two points of <i>hope</i> to counter that dread. Good thing I did that temple service...</span></li>

        <h2>Malevolent Anchors</h2>
        <p>Malevolent forces typically maintain their powerful dread zones through special <i>anchors</i>—cursed rings, sinister cultists, arcane sigils, desecrated temples, etc. These anchors are a source of great strength and influence, but also great weakness—when an anchor is destroyed, a measure of dreadful power is forever lost.</p>
        <p>When you want to add some exploitable weaknesses to your dread zones, consider using <i>anchors</i>.</p>

        <h3>Creating an Anchor</h3>
        <p>To create a malevolent anchor, follow these four steps:</p>

        <h4><span class="h4__highlight">1</span>Choose a Category</h4>
        <p>Anchors come in all manner of shapes and sizes, and there are three common categories—items, peoples, and places:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Items:</strong> Magic swords, cursed books, powerful rings—these special items radiate with dread.</li>
          <li><strong>Peoples:</strong> Elite cultists, demonic overlords, elemental princes—these creatures help to spread dread.</li>
          <li><strong>Places:</strong> Desecrated temples, fey groves, elemental leylines, corrupted graveyards—these significant locations are bathed in dread.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Choose a variety of anchor types and descriptions that are flavorful for your dread zone and malevolent force.</p>

        <h4><span class="h4__highlight">2</span>Choose a Strength</h4>
        <p>The stronger the anchor is, the more it will increase your maximum dread—and the longer it will take to create. These strong, <i>valuable</i> anchors can be a tempting target to any cunning adventurer, so be prepared to defend them.</p>

        <h4><span class="h4__highlight">3</span>Choose a Weakness</h4>
        <p>Finally, decide what must be done by an adventurer to destroy the anchor—for example:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Damage:</strong> The anchor can be destroyed through damage—smashing, slashing, crushing, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Purification:</strong> The anchor can be purified in some means—consecration, an exorcism, an arcane ritual, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Quest:</strong> The anchor can only be destroyed in a specific way—cast into the fire of a volcano, stabbed by a shadowblade, put into direct sunlight, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span class="h4__highlight">4</span>Update your Dread</h4>
        <p>When you use <i>malevolent anchors</i>, the maximum available dread is equal to the sum of all currently active anchors—update this value when you finish creating a new anchor.</p>

        <col-break></col-break>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The GM wants to use <i>malevolent anchors</i> for their Westing dread zone. They create the following anchors (giving the Hag Queen a total of 20 maximum dread) and spread them across the adventure for the players to encounter:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Dire Werewolf (x2):</strong> +5 max. dread (each).</li>
              <li><strong>Fey Totem (×5):</strong> +2 max. dread (each).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During their exploration of the Darkroot Forest, the party discover a <i>fey totem</i> hidden in a wild grove. When they successfully destroy the totem, the Hag Queen's maximum dread is reduced from 20 to 18.</p>
            <p>It will take the Hag Queen 2 days to create a new fey totem as a replacement.</p>

        </example>

        <h3>The Linchpin</h3>
        <p>A malevolent force can be tied to a dread zone by one anchor in particular—the <i>linchpin</i>. This linchpin serves as a direct conduit between the world and your almighty power, and is extremely precious—destroying it will vanquish the dread zone in one fell swoop.</p>
        <p>There are a variety of linchpin types—choose one as best befits your adventure from the examples below, or create your own:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mortal Avatar:</strong> A single avatar acts as the conduit. These avatars are typically chosen, gifted, blessed, or possessed—willingly or otherwise.</li>
          <li><strong>Artifact:</strong> A powerful artifact ties the force to this world.</li>
          <li><strong>Place:</strong> A place has been turned into a font of power.</li>
          <li><strong>Sigil:</strong> A spell sigil has been inscribed somewhere, drawing in otherworldly power.</li>
          <li><strong>Oath:</strong> A powerful oath binds a power to the realm.</li>
        </ul>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The <i>Dark Curse</i> over Westing is held in place by a linchpin anchor—a <i>spell sigil</i> written in blood in the Hag Queen's hut.</p>

        <h2>Campaign Integration</h2>
        <p>Dread can be a powerful tool in a campaign, helping you to dive deeper into the theming of an almighty being whilst adding new challenges—and threats—for your players.</p>
        <p>Listed below are some ways you can integrate this feature into your game, either as some light flavor or as a solid basis for an entire campaign.</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">A</span>A Light Touch</h3>
        <p>This malevolent force has <i>limited</i> influence in a particular region. With only 5-10 points of dread, your ability to trigger <i>dreadful effects</i> is greatly restricted—so choose your moments carefully.</p>
        <p>Pick this option when you want to a) add some light flavor to an adventuring space or b) remind players that they are being watched by a powerful entity.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The party are travelling through an old, long ruined shrine to Tiamat. The GM wants to hint at Tiamat's limited—but lingering—influence here, and so assigns a mere 5 points of dread and a couple of effects.</p>
          </section>
        </example>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">B</span>A Powerful Presence</h3>
        <p>This malevolent force has <i>formidable</i> influence in a particular region. With 20-80 points of dread, your ability to complicate life is noticable—and dangerous.</p>
        <p>Use this option when you want players to be actively concerned about dread, taking actions to learn about it and minimise—or counter—the harm.</p>

        <aside class="panel panel--aside">

            <h4 class="panel__title">Announcing Dread</h4>
          </header>
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>When you include dread in your game, try to communicate it clearly to your players—in particular, how it may harm them and how they can counter it.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Foreshadow:</strong> When you describe a dread zone to your players, try to hint at it in your descriptions—such as with the keyword "dreadful".</li>
              <li><strong>Rumors:</strong> Use your NPCs to deliver information—and warnings—about local dread zones and their effects.</li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Research:</strong> Allow your players to perform research on suspected <i>dreadful</i> locations during their downtime.</p>
                <p>With appropriate successes, you may decide to reveal some information—such as the current maximum dread, the range of dreadful effects, and the location of malevolent anchors.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Experience:</strong> If players enter a dread zone unwittingly, consider asking them to make a relevant ability check to detect a malevolent, dreadful presence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When in doubt, err on the side of giving your players <i>too much information</i> about your dread zones—the more information your players have, the more pro-active and engaged they can be with your content.</p>

            <p>The GM creates a set of malevolent anchors to represent Baphamet's control in this region, giving the Demon Lord a maximum of 40 points of dread:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Horn of Baphamet:</strong> +20 max. dread.</li>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">C</span>The Impossible Lair</h3>
        <p>This malevolent force has taken absolute control of a particular region. With 160 (or more) points of dread and a full range of dreadful effects—in addition to the regular assortment of monsters, tricks, and traps—this is a formidable (if not fatal) challenge for a fully-stocked adventuring party.</p>
        <p>While the party can attempt to conquer this impossible lair at <i>any</i> time, they are encouraged to explore the land, hunt malevolent anchors, and defeat them to reduce the overall threat of the impossible lair.</p>
        <p>Use this option when you want a solid basis for an exploration-forcused sandbox campaign (such as a <i>West Marches</i> game).</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>An evil sorcerer-king—Calamity Shrike—has taken absolute control of the kingdom of Highrune and now spreads corruption from his Throne of Power in the ruined palace. With 160 points of dread—and a full host of monsters—Calamity Shrike is merciless to any who would dare enter the Corrupt Palace of Highrune.</p>
            <p>The players can attempt to attack Calamity Shrike straight away—<i>or</i> they may choose to visit the four <i>Divine Beasts</i>, cleanse the corrupted shrines, and hunt the <i>Aspects of Calamity</i> to reduce the effects of Calamity's dread:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Divine Beasts (×4):</strong> +20 max. dread (each).</li>
              <li><strong>Aspect of Calamity (×4):</strong> +10 max. dread (each).</li>
              <li><strong>Greater Corrupt Shrine (×6):</strong> +5 max. dread (each).</li>
              <li><strong>Lesser Corrupt Shrine (×5):</strong> +2 max. dread (each).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pursing all of these optional sidequests will (in addition to regular rewards such as loot, xp, and gold) reduce Calamity Shrike's dread to zero, making this impossible lair a <i>much</i> more achievable goal.</p>
