				<h1 id="active-initiative">Active Initiative</h1>
				<p>Combat isn't a polite state of affairs and monsters don't wait in line to take their turn—battle is wild and unpredictable. Work with your allies to support each other, make plans, chain together powers, and exploit weak points like a well-oiled fighting machine.</p>
				<p>This chapter introduces the <i>Active Initiative</i> system, allowing players to choose who acts next in the round.</p>

				<h2>The Dynamic Round</h3>
				<p>With <i>Active Initiative</i>, there is no pre-determined order of initiative. Instead, once a person has finished their turn, they get to choose who goes next—another player, group of monsters, or environmental hazard.</p>
				<p>A basic round follows four simple steps:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>Who goes first?:</strong> Decide who triggered the scene and acted first. Did you throw the first punch?</li>
					<li><strong>Take turns:</strong> Take your turn. Once you've finished your actions, you get to pick who goes next.</li>
					<li><strong>End the round:</strong> Once everyone's finished their turn, end the round and clear up any expired effects.</li>
					<li><strong>Start a new round:</strong> If there's still conflict, the last person to act gets to decide who starts the new round.</li>
				</ol>

						<h4 class="panel__title">Why Use Active Initiative?</h4>
					</header>
					<section class="panel__body">
						<p>There are four main benefits to using <i>Active Initiative</i>:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Better teamwork:</strong> Players can work together more easily to chain actions together into big combo-moves.</li>
							<li><strong>More communication:</strong> Players talk more to each other.</li>
							<li><strong>More attentive players:</strong> Players are actively watching what's happening for opportunities to jump in and act.</li>
							<li><strong>It's easy:</strong> No dice or math—just say who goes next.</li>
						</ol>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">1</span>Who Goes First?</h3>
				<p>First, you must decide who (or what) acted first and thereby triggered the scene. Most times it will be obvious who started things—someone throws the first punch, steps on the trap, or casts a spell.</p>
				<p>If it's <i>not</i> obvious who acted first, you can determine this randomly by rolling for initiative—whoever rolls highest goes first. Once the first turn is complete, switch to dynamic turn ordering as described in step 2.</p>

				<example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<ul class="chat">
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>You're caught in an ambush, Valiant—four goblins and their hobgoblin leader, Brakkus. She sneers at you. "Throw down your weapon, cleric, and maybe we'll only cut off <i>one</i> hand."</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>I haven't forgotten your last betrayal, Brakkus—I'll <i>never</i> surrender. I raise my shield and charge.</li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>Sounds like you're triggering the fight with that charge, Valiant—you have the first turn.</span></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</example>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">2</span>Take Turns</h3>
				<p>Take your turn as normal. Once you've finished your turn, you get to pick who goes next—this can be any other character, creature, hazard, or group of monsters that hasn't acted yet in the current round.</p>
				<p><strong>Interrupting:</strong> Anyone who takes damage during your turn can steal the initiative at the end of your turn (see <i>Interrupting</i>), so be careful who you attack.</p>

				<h4>Delaying</h4>
				<p>You can't pass or delay once your turn begins, but you <i>can</i> ready an action. This doesn't change your turn order—if your readied action is the last act in a turn, you don't get to choose the next person to act.</p>

						<h4 class="panel__title">Monster Groups</h4>
					</header>
					<section class="panel__body">
						<p>Avoid side-vs-side combat by creating a wide variety of distinct, taggable monster groups. As a general rule of thumb, aim for at least 1 taggable monster/group for every two players at the start of a scene.</p>
					</section>
				</aside>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">3</span>End the Round</h3>
				<p>Once every person has finished their turn, end the round as normal and clear up any expired or time-sensitive effects—spells, powers, cooldowns, event timers, etc.</p>

				<h4>Effect Durations</h4>
				<p>Effects that last a specific duration of rounds tick down at the end of each round. Once a duration reaches 0, the effect has ended and can be removed.</p>
				<p>Any effects that would expire at the start or end of your turn are unchanged, expiring as normal.</p>

				<example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<p>Valiant casts <i>Bless</i>—a concentration spell that lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds). At the end of each round, the remaining duration simply decreases by 1 round.</p>
						<p>Clanda, meanwhile, uses <i>Shield</i> to deflect an attack. The spell ends when she takes her next turn.</p>
					</section>
				</example>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">4</span>Start a New Round</h3>
				<p>If there's still conflict to resolve, start a new round. The last person to act in the current round decides who starts the new round—they can't pick themselves.</p>

				<h2>Interrupting</h2>
				<p>If you haven't taken your turn yet this round, you have a chance to <i>steal</i> the initiative and take the next turn even if you weren't nominated—this is called an <i>interrupt</i>. There are two main ways you can do this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Spend Inspiration:</strong> You can spend an <i>inspiration point</i> to interrupt.</li>
					<li><strong>Take Some Damage:</strong> If you took damage during the last turn, you can choose to interrupt for free.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>If you want to interrupt, you must do so before the next person starts their turn. You can't interrupt if you've already acted this round, and you can't interrupt an ally.</p>

				<h3>Variant: Interrupt Points</h3>
				<p>If players are spending their inspiration points often to make interrupts—or you want your monsters to be more reactive in general—consider this <i>Interrupt Points</i> variant.</p>
				<p>At the start of each significant scene (such as a combat encounter), the GM gains one free <i>interrupt point</i> per player. The GM may spend one of these points to steal the initiative, but can only use one point per round. Any unspent points expire at the end of the scene.</p>

				<h2>Example of Play</h2>
				<p>Here's an example of how to use <i>Active Initiative</i> in a basic round of combat—Chansi, Valiant, and Clanda are fighting a hobgoblin and four goblins.</p>
				<p>With three players, the GM divides the monsters into two taggable groups—the hobgoblin and the goblins. The <i>Interrupt Points</i> variant is in play, so the GM gains three interrupt points for this scene.</p>
				<p>At the start of a new round, Chansi makes an attack and then passes over to Valiant.</p>

				<example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<ul class="chat">
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>The hobgoblin roars an order out to the goblins and they spring forward. Chansi, what do you do?</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Chansi:</span><span>I fire an arrow straight at the hobgoblin... <span class="chat__action">(rolls 11)</span> ...oof, that's a bad shot.</li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>Your arrow misses by a wide margin. The hobgoblin shouts a command and three of the goblins turn to look at you, Chansi.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Chansi:</span><span>Uh, that doesn't sound good. Hey, Valiant, might need you to draw some attention here...</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>I'm on it. I move to cover Chansi and strike at the nearest goblin with my war pick <span class="chat__action">(rolls 16)</span>.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>The goblin curses aloud as you strike it. How much damage does it take?</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>6 points. Then, with my <i>War Priest initiative</i>, I swing around to attack another goblin <span class="chat__action">(rolls 17)</span>.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>Another hit—the goblin screeches as it takes...?</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>7 points of bludgeoning damage. Now <i>that</i> should get their attention.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>It does—three goblins are now focused on you.</span></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</example>

				<p>Having finished his turn, Valiant prepares to pass over to Clanda. The GM, however, chooses to <i>interrupt</i> with one of the monster groups.</p>
				<p>Because the goblins took damage during Valiant's turn, they can interrupt for free. However, the GM spends an <i>Interrupt Point</i> to allow the hobgoblin to act instead.</p>

				<example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<ul class="chat">
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>Ok Clanda, you're up next.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Clanda:</span><span>Perfect. I—</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>Before you can act, Clanda, the hobgoblin interrupts... <span class="chat__action">(spends an interrupt point)</span> ...and leaps towards Valiant. She swings her longsword in a fierce two-handed arc and hits, dealing 6 damage.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>Ouch.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>With the goblins around you, Valiant, the hobgoblin uses <i>Martial Advantage</i> to deal an additional 7 points of damage.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Valiant:</span><span>Son of a...</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>The hobgoblin laughs coldly, licking the blood from her blade. "You have my attention <i>now</i>, little cleric," she sneers. "I think I'll take your right hand as a trophy." The goblins begin to move—</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Clanda:</span><span>I think not... <span class="chat__action">(spends an inspiration point to Interrupt)</span> Enough of this nonsense. Don't move, Valiant, unless you want this <i>Fireball</i> in your face...</span></li>
