        <h1 id="trials">Trials</h1>
        <p>Not every encounter has to end up in combat—sometimes, your skills can be mightier than your sword. When you need to solve a lot of <i>small</i> tasks to overcome one <i>big</i> problem, you're in a trial.</p>
        <p>This chapter introduces <i>Trials</i>, how to create them, and advice on how to run them in your games.</p>

        <h2>A Trial</h2>
        <p>In a trial, players seek to accomplish a goal by completing a series of smaller tasks. They do this by working together and making <i>ability checks</i>—the more successes they get, the more tasks they can complete. Too many failures, however, and penalities may occur—or the entire trial may be forfeit.</p>
        <p>Trials can take any form—a chase through a bustling city, decrypting a necromancer's sinister spellbook, exploring a fetid dungeon, a parley with a formidable warlord, a war against an infernal army—so be creative.</p>

            <p>Chansi, Valiant, and Clanda are trapped in the Storm Wilds, surrounded by a horde of animated shadows sent by the Twilight Crown.</p>
            <p>In a clearing, Clanda discovers the broken ruins of an elven portal. Can the adventurers reactivate the portal in time to escape the attacking shadows...?</p>

        <h2 id="running-a-trial">Running a Trial</h2>
        <p>Once you have a trial mapped out for your players, it's time to put it into play. Follow these steps when running trials in your game:</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">1</span>Triggering a Trial</h3>
        <p>A trial can begin at any point—when a player tries to intimidate a formidable NPC, when a monster chases the party through a dark forest, when the rogue triggers a trap mid-combat, etc.</p>
        <p>Once it looks like a trial is about to take place, announce it to the party.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<ul class="chat">
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>You hear the whine of arcane power building up in the metal sphere—this force bomb will detonate in less than one minute. Clanda—what do you do?</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Clanda:</span><span>I'm going to disarm the bomb, of course.</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>Excellent—a risky gambit. A <i>trial</i> has begun...</span></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</example>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">2</span>Set the Stage</h3>
        <p>Now, you must set the stage. It's important to let the players know the <i>details</i> of their trial—if your players aren't aware of their situation, they can't enagage with it in a fun or meaningful way.</p>
        <p>Describe the rough outline of the trial—the goal, the tasks, the expected outcomes, and the effective difficulty (DC, successes required, pacing, deadlines, etc.).</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<ul class="chat">
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>This is a simple but <i>hard</i> trial—you need 5 DC 20 successes. If you succeed, you'll stop the bomb from exploding, if you don't...</span></li>
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Clanda:</span><span>So, don't drop the exploding death ball? Got it. What do I need to do?</span></li>
              <li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>You think there are three tasks: 1) carefully open the bomb casing, 2) decipher the arcane sigils within, and 3) countermand the spell.</span></li>
              <li><span class="chat__speaker">Clanda:</span><span>How long do I have?</span></li>
              <li><span class="chat__speaker">GM:</span><span>You think <i>maybe</i> 10 rounds—but you're not sure.</span></li>

        <h4>Limited Information</h4>
        <p>You may decide that <i>some</i> information is—at first—obsured to players. Consider allowing them to discover this information with appropriate Intelligence checks—or other checks as appropriate.</p>

          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>It may be tempting to hide the mechanical details of a trial from your players. However, this can lead to frustration—an unclear trial is a trial your players can't easily contribute to.</p>
            <p>Ensure that players can interact properly with your trials by describing them with the same mechanical clarity as you would a combat encounter.</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">3</span>Making a Check</h3>
        <p>Whenever a player describes an action they are taking to resolve a task, the GM can ask that player to make an <i>ability check</i> against the DC of the trial.</p>
        <p>Once the player makes their roll, check the <i>Trial Check Results</i> table below to see what the outcome is.</p>
        <p><strong>Open Skills:</strong> When you decide which ability check to ask for, use attributes and skills in <i>any</i> combination as best matches the player's action.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantage & Disadvantage:</strong> Depending on the situation and the action taken, you may choose to grant either advantage or disadvantage to the player's roll.</p>

        <h4 id="making-a-check-substitutions">Substitutions</h4>
        <p>Your players may have access to special resources—tools, spells, gear, allies, etc. When a player opts to use one of these resources, consider one of the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>It helps the situation:</strong> Grant a) advantage on a roll, b) one automatic success, or c) two automatic successes.</li>
          <li><strong>It makes things worse:</strong> Grant a) disadvantage on a roll, b) one automatic failure, or c) two automatic failures.</li>
        </ul>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
						<ul class="chat">
							<li><span class="chat__speaker">Clanda:</span><span>Can I use <i>Identify</i> to decifer these spell sigils?</span></li>

        <h4>Improvised Tasks</h4>
        <p>Your players may naturally improvise tasks of their own based the trial's description. Try to be flexible with your trial outline—if the players have a good idea, incorporate it as best you can.</p>

        <h4>Failure Consequences</h4>
        <p>Depending on the trial and the action taken by the player, you can apply a <i>consequence</i> if an ability check results in a failure—taking damage, spending hit die, burning spell slots, losing gold, etc.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
            <p>Clanda rolls a failure when trying to countermand the spell powering the arcane bomb. The GM decides to apply a consequence—arcane power lashes out and Clanda takes 2d12 points of force damage.</p>
					</section>
        </example>

        <h4>Making an Attack</h4>
        <p>Your players may opt to make an <i>attack</i> as their action within a trial. To resolve these attacks, don't use attack rolls or saving throws—instead, resolve them as a simple <i>ability check</i> based on the attack action described by the player. For example:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A barbarian swings her axe with great power at an iron golem? Make a <strong>Strength (Athletics)</strong> check.</i></li>
          <li>A rogue shoots a crossbow whilst hidden in the shadows? Make a <strong>Dexterity (Stealth)</strong> check.</li>
          <li>An eldritch knight slashes a green flame blade at fearsome lich? Make an <strong>Intelligence (Athletics)</strong> check.</i></li>
          <li>A wizard casts <i>magic missile</i> with great haste at a charging dragon? Make a <strong>Intelligence (Arcana)</strong> check.</li>
          <li>A cleric casts <i>sacred flame</i> at a rampaging zombie? Make a <strong>Wisdom (Religion)</strong> check.</li>
          <li>A druid casts <i>entangle</i> on a group of rowdy kobolds? Make a <strong>Wisdom (Nature)</strong> check.</li>
          <li>A draconic sorcerer uses <i>burning hands</i> on a swarm of rats? Make a <strong>Charisma (Arcana)</strong> check.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Using Class Features & Abilities</h5>
        <p>If the player uses a relevant ability—such as a class feature, spell, or other resource—consider granting them advantage (or an automatic success) to the roll.</p>
        
        <example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
            <p>To <i>hold back the horde</i>, Valiant wants to attack the overwhelming shadows of the Twilight Crown with his mace. The GM asks for a Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
            <p>Because Valiant has the <i>Divine Strike</i> passive ability—and the shadows are vulnerable to radiant—the GM grants advantage to the roll.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>When you assign an ability check to a player's attack action, keep in mind the skillset of that character—try to use skills that complement the character well. Encourage players to describe actions in the context of their character skills.</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">4</span>Add Challenges</h3>
        <p>Trials are at their best when the narrative evolves with each ability check, expanding the story and encouraging a variety of abilities and skills. So if you find that players are relying on the same actions and abilities to solve a task, consider mixing things up with a <i>challenge</i>.</p>
        <p>Describe a change in the narrative that puts one or more characters in a difficult—or perilous—situation. Use this opportunity to put the spotlight on a particular character, ability, or skillset.</p>

            <p>Valiant <i>could</i> simply use Strength (Athletics) each time to <i>hold back the horde</i> with melee attacks. But to keep things interesting, the GM decides to introduce some challenges. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A giant shadow grabs hold of you with suprising speed, Valiant, lifting you up off the ground. You see sinister tendrils wrapping around you—what do you do?</li>
              <li>A shadowmage calls out a piercing cry and encases you in a <i>twilight barrier</i>, Valiant. Dark sigils blind and restrain you—what do you do?</li>
              <li>Thunder crackles ominiously as rain pours from the blackened sky. The ground beneath your feet is slick and tretcherous, Valiant—what do you do?</li>
              <li>As you battle the horde, Valiant, one of the twilight crown sinks into your shadow. You suddenly stumble and fall prone as it tries to possess you through your own shadow—what do you do?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Valiant must now describe a different action in reaction to the challenge which may require a different ability, skill, or feature.</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">5</span>Ending a Trial</h3>
        <p>No trial lasts forever. All things must end, and a trial typically concludes in one of four ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Victory:</strong> The players have rolled enough successes to complete the trial. Check the trial's list of outcomes to see what happens next—the fewer failures, the better the outcome.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Major Defeat:</strong> When a trial gains five failures, it ends automatically in a <i>major defeat</i>.</li>
          <li><strong>Expiration:</strong> The deadline expires. This may result in a consequence—such as a <i>critical failure</i>.</li>
          <li><strong>Abandon:</strong> The players abandon the trial to pursue another objective. Depending on the trial, this may result in a consequence.</li>
        </ul>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
					<section class="panel__body">
            <p>After some tense rolls, Clanda rolls 5 successes in her trial to disarm the arcane bomb. The trial ended with 2 failures—a <i>minor victory</i>.</p>
            <p>She disarms the bomb safely, but is unable to recover any information about who created it.</p>

        <h2>Building a Trial</h2>
        <p>Once you have an idea for a trial, follow these six steps to start building it:</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">1</span>Set the Goal & Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Your first step is to define the overall goal of your skill challenge—what is it the players are trying to accomplish?</p>
        <p>You must then decide on the outcomes of the trial: what happens when the players succeed or fail in their efforts? There are four outcomes to any trial:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Major Victory (0 failures):</strong> The goal is achieved with exceptional results–the players gain additional benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor Victory (1-2 failures):</strong> The goal is achieved.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor Defeat (3-4 failures):</strong> The players fail to achieve the goal <i>or</i> achieve it but suffer a significant penalty.</li>
          <li><strong>Major Defeat (5 failures):</strong> The players fail to achieve the goal <i>and</i> suffer a catastrophic penalty.</li>
        </ol>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The goal of Krazak, Viridian, and Crackle is to explore a sunken crypt in the <i>Umbral Deeps</i>—rumored to be the lair of the necromancer <i>Jander Skull</i>.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Major Victory:</strong> The party find a secret stash of treasure. They recover 1000 gp, a scroll of <i>Raise Dead</i>, and a <i>Sword of LIfe Stealing</i>.</li>
              <li><strong>Minor Victory:</strong> The party explore the crypt. They recover 100 gp and a scroll of <i>Raise Dead</i>.</li>
              <li><strong>Minor Defeat:</strong> The party are overwhelmed by the undead, escaping with two levels of exhaustion.</li>
              <li><strong>Major Defeat:</strong> The party run afoul of <i>Jander Skull</i>. One party member is killed, and the others escape with two levels of exhaustion.</li>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">2</span>Difficulty & Complexity</h3>
        <p>Next, you must choose a baseline <i>difficulty</i> and <i>complexity</i> for your trial. The higher the difficulty, the harder it will be for your players to succeed in their efforts—and the higher the complexity, the more successes your players must achieve.

        <p>Now it's time to break down the goal—and the required successes—down into smaller, narrative-focused tasks.</p>
        <p>A <i>task</i> describes a specific objective that should (or <i>must</i>) be met by the players to accomplish the goal of the trial. Use these to create a variety of small, narrative challenges for the party to overcome during the trial.</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example example--creating-tasks">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>After some consideration, the GM creates the following tasks for their 15 × DC 15 trial:</p>

                <p><strong>Enter the Crypt</strong> (2 successes)</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Battle the Undead:</strong> (5 successes)</p>
                <p><i>(Requirements: A)</i> Defend yourself against the risen undead that roam the crypt.</p>

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>Some tasks may have requirements—sequencing, tools, skills, abilities, etc. Add requirements where necessary to a) create a variety of challenges for the party and b) strengthen the narrative theming of your trial—try to highlight multiple skillsets whenever possible.</p>

        <h4>Task Themes</h4>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, try to put the spotlight on at least <i>two</i> sets of primary skills within each trial—the more skills you support, the easier you make it for players to participate.</p>
        <p>Use the task themes listed below as a starting point to help you allocate some skill spotlights:</p>

        <h3>Improving your Chances</h3>
        <p>A low ability bonus isn't the end of the world—there's (almost) always a way to improve your odds and help out in a trial. To boost your chances, consider the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Help/Assist:</strong> Spend your action to <i>help</i> another character with their ability check, granting them advantage in their efforts.</li>
          <li><strong>Spells & Features:</strong> Use special magics and character features to gain ability bonuses, advantages, or—depending on the situation—automatic successes.</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Use tools creatively to bypass tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Creative Thinking:</strong> Think outside the box and use your talents in creative ways within the scenario.</li>
        </ul>

        <col-break></col-break>

        <h2>Variant Dials</h2>
        <p>If you want to customize <i>Trials</i> for your game, consider the following variant dials.</p>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">A</span>Task DCs</h3>
        <p>Use <i>Task DCs</i> if you want to run a more <i>granular</i> trial with a variety of DC modifiers.</p>
        <p>When you create a task for a trial that you think is notably easier or harder than normal, apply a relative DC modifier to it: easiest (-4), easier (-2), normal (+0), harder (+2), or hardest (+4).</p>

        <example class="panel panel--example">
          <section class="panel__body">
            <p>The GM wants to use <i>Task DCs</i> with the <i>Crypt of Jander Skull</i> trial (DC 15). They apply the following modifiers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enter the Crypt:</strong> Easiest (DC 11)</li>
              <li><strong>Explore the Sunken Chamber:</strong> Normal (DC 15)</li>
              <li><strong>Battle the Undead:</strong> Normal (DC 15)</li>
              <li><strong>Defeat Jander Skull:</strong> Harder (DC 17)</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
        </example>

        <h3><span class="h3__highlight">B</span>Spellpower Successes</h3>
        <p>If you want a more <i>precise</i> method for determining which spells can trigger automatic successes, use this <i>Spellpower Successes</i> variant.</p>
        <p>To gain advantage or automatic successes on an ability check during a trial, a spell must be of a minimum level relative to the DC—as shown in the table below.</p>

        <h2>Trial Templates</h2>
        <p>To get you started with trials, here are some example templates you can use in your games. Use these templates as a starting point—adjust the difficulties, pacing, deadlines, and apply your own theming where appropriate.</p>
